# Other Schema Files
#-------------------
# This section specifies other configuration files that contain
# metadata information. Files are loaded in order, and the 
# directives in this file are loaded last. 
# File paths are specified relative to the application's 'config' directory. 
# Schema information from all files are merged together. Some options
# may be overridden in files loaded later. 
# Other options must be defined only once per property
# and cannot be overwritten. These include "predicate" and "definition".

# Property Settings
#-------------------
# This section defines every metadata property that can be used 
# in the system. Individual work types may override some settings 
# defined here. Predicates for each property should be defined
# here, and cannot be overridden once defined.

properties:

  call_number:
    label: "Internal Idenfication Number"
    usage_note: "Use this for both call numbers and GQQQWYKID numbers."

  scale:
    label: "Scale"
    definition: "Ratio of the dimensions of a form contained or embodied in a resource to the dimensions of the entity it represents, e.g., for images or cartographic resources."
    usage_note: "Use this for scales of maps, aerial photos, and/or scanned documents. "
    
    predicate: "Bibframe:cartographicScale"
    range: "rdfs:Literal"

  date_published:
    definition: "Date of formal issuance (e.g., publication) of the resource."

#-------------------
# Work Type Settings
#-------------------
# Here we define metadata settings based on work type.
# This section specifies which properties (defined above)
# may be applied to each work type, and may specify display
# settings such as "required" or "hidden".
# 
# In the future, this may be extended to actually define 
# the work types for the application here.
