# Shared Geospatial Property Settings
# EXAMPLE - NOT AN ACTUAL SCHEMA
#-------------------
# This section defines every metadata property that can be used 
# in the system. Individual work types may override some settings 
# defined here. Predicates for each property should be defined
# here, and cannot be overridden once defined.

properties:

  coordinates:
    definition: Spatial characteristics of the resource.
    predicate: "DC:spatial"

# obviously this would be more complicated in an actual schema, but hopefully you get the idea of how it might work
