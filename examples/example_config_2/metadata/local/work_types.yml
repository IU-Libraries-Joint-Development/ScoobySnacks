# Work Type Settings
# EXAMPLE - NOT A REAL SCHEMA
#-------------------
# Here we define metadata settings based on work type.
# This section specifies which properties (defined above)
# may be applied to each work type, and may specify display
# settings such as "required" or "hidden".
# 
# In the future, this may be extended to actually define 
# the work types for the application here.
